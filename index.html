      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I am an Assistant Professor at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan
      School of Information</a>. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a target="_blank" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/">Microsoft Research New York</a>.
      I received my PhD from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at University of California, Santa Barbara in December 2012.
      I received my Bachelors degree from Computer Science Department at Bilkent University in Turkey in 2007.
      </p>

      <p>My research interests lie in the area of computational social science;
      a discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and the social sciences.
      I am particularly interested in applying large scale data analysis techniques to study problems with social,
      political, and policy implications.
      </p>

      <h2>Prospective Students</h3>

      <p>Prospective PhD students must first be admitted to UMSI's PhD program before they can work with an individual advisor.

        Undergraduate and Masters students who have already been admitted to the University of Michigan and are interested
        in working on computational social science problems are welcome to contact me.
        Include your interests, degree, major, and resume in your email. </p>
